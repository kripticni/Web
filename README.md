# Web development

A repository made for learning about web programming,  
the target will be to make the learning experience  
as practical as possible and to have a repository  
that others could use to learn more about these languages.  

Personally, I'm learning about web programming  
to improve at web hacking/exploitation but also  
for versatility and the generalist knowledge a  
pentester/hacker is required to have.  

# Target

Made for quick learners and programmers that already  
have experience in a lot of languages, and anyone  
who picks things up quickly.  
Aims to astablish foundations through fast and quality  
courses and then finish up the said languages with the  
documentation for the language itself, while also  
leaving a website to which the source code itself  
will serve as a cheatsheet to.  

# Languages

At the basic level and for a while, this repository  
will only support the ordinary web trio:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript

But in the future, looking forward to expand to:
- A web development framework or library
- PHP
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui
